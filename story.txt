You wake up to find yourself in a carriage taking you somewhere. It's a dark desolate day and you're surrounded by trees
 and green fields. There are two other passengers riding along with you. A man, with white hair and brown, dirty clothes
 turns to you and says "Hey, you're finally awake".

Your hands are bound, and you wear a tattered and desolate cloth.
"God dammnit. I'm in Skyrim, aren't I?"
The stranger raises a confused eye brow, baffled by the phrase. His features are unmistakeable. A Nord if you ever saw
one. "F%@# this" you cry hurling yourself from the cart, landing upon the rocky ground with a hard thud, and a snap.

You awake again on a large flat plane. Bright lights shine all about you, blinding you from the world beyond. All at
once, the lights go off. As you begin to stand up, you hear footsteps approach. A deafening sound comes over you,
and the lights come back on to reveal the source of the commotion. You see his face, and instintivly recoil.
It's him.
Todd Howard.
