You wake up to find yourself in a carriage taking you somewhere. It's a dark desolate day and you're surrounded by trees
 and green fields. There are two other passengers riding along with you. A man, with white hair and brown, dirty clothes
 turns to you and says "Hey, you're finally awake".

Your hands are bound, and you wear a tattered and desolate cloth.
"God dammnit. I'm in Skyrim, aren't I?"
The stranger raises a confused eye brow, baffled by the phrase. His features are unmistakeable. A Nord if you ever saw
one. "F%@# this" you cry hurling yourself from the cart, landing upon the rocky ground with a hard thud, and a snap.
